          <p> Jordan is precise, honest and managed to diagnose two computer issues of mine without charging me - just to be helpful. A very honest family business run from a private home workshop.  Highly recommend him for his services!  - John</p>
          
          <p>One of my nightmares: My flash drive crashed and all files were corrupted.  I had a lot of important school documents.  I found Jordan on Yelp and he even accommodated a late evening appointment.  In short, Jordan was able to locate all my files and transferred to a more secure flash drive. Price is reasonable.  I've also backed up all my files in case i lose it again.  Thanks Jordan!  - Tom</p>
                 
         <p>Jordan is a computer wizard!!!!! He worked his magic with my computer bringing it back to life after it was infected with so many viruses. Greg definitely lives up to his company's name, Five stars indeed!  - Terry</p>
     
         <p>Another small problem with a portable external drive.  Jordan as usual realized how to fix quickly.  His service is outstanding.  If you need repairs, this is the place to go.  - Alexis</p>
